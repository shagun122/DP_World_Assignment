## DP World Assignment : DoorDash ETA Prediction
This repository contains the solution to the DoorDash ETA Prediction Assignment provided by DP World. The project includes a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and predicting delivery Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on the dataset.

### Project Workflow
* Data Analysis : Initial exploration of the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key metrics.
* Data Preprocessing : Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
* Baseline Model Comparison : Constructing and evaluating baseline models to establish a performance benchmark.
* Further Data Analysis and Model Training : Advanced exploration to refine features and optimize the model.

### Key Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into delivery patterns and factors affecting ETA.
* Data Preprocessing: Transformation and feature selection to enhance model performance.
* Model Development: Creation and comparison of machine learning models for ETA prediction .
* Visualization: Intuitive plots and charts to communicate findings effectively.

### Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc...

### Results and Insights
* The project demonstrates : Key factors influencing delivery times.
* Model evaluation metrics for accurate ETA prediction.
